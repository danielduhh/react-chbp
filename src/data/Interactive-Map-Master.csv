100,Y,The Scotch Pine,Service,"The Scotch Pine barbershop is romantic. It swoons for close shaves with hot lather and blushes for both old school and modern cuts. Much more than a place to get your hair cut, The Scotch Pine manifests a classic vibe. It’s like that feeling when the first song comes on or when the cold can is cracked open or when the cloth is pulled from your chest to reveal a newly expressed you. The stylists at The Scotch Pine bring an artistic touch within the rustic warm walls of the wooden, industrial Northwest room. Offering you a place to feel at home, relaxed and lovingly refreshed.",thescotchpine.com
